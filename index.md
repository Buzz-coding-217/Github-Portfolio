# Hi, I'm Shravel Sharma ðŸ‘‹

I've been passionate about coding since high school â€” starting with the basics and diving deeper every year into areas like **IoT**, **edge computing**, **machine learning**, and **web development**. What began as curiosity quickly became a journey of building, experimenting, and solving real-world problems through technology.

Currently, Iâ€™m actively involved in a research project focused on **machine learning in edge computing environments**, where we explore how to make intelligent systems more energy-efficient and responsive. This research is being prepared for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.


This portfolio showcases the work I've done â€” not just to demonstrate my technical growth, but to share how I'm applying it to meaningful challenges.


# Featured Projects



## Smart Shopping Store using IoT

A customer-centric embedded system that uses sensors and edge devices to:
- Detect items picked from shelves.
- Update cart and billing in real-time.
- Enhance in-store experience through automation.

_Stack: Raspberry Pi, Sensors, MQTT, Node.js_

## IoT-Based Mushroom Growth Monitor

Developed a smart farming solution to monitor mushroom cultivation by tracking:
- Humidity, Temperature, and Light using sensors.
- Alerts and controls via edge dashboard.

_Stack: Raspberry Pi, HiveMQ, Python, Web Interface_

> "Making farming smarter through data-driven insights."

## Energy-Aware Edge ML System

Worked on optimizing **machine learning inference on edge devices** while reducing power consumption using:
- Custom scheduling algorithms (Min-Min, Max-Min, MET, etc.)
- Performance vs Energy trade-off analysis on Raspberry Pi clusters

> "Bringing intelligence closer to data."

## Crowd Monitoring with YOLOv5

Built a real-time crowd detection system:
- Customized YOLOv5 to detect only people.
- Defined zones to assess density and movement patterns.

_Image & video inputs analyzed at the edge._


## Robotic Cloth Placement using Reinforcement Learning

As part of a research internship, developed a collaborative robotic system:
- Two robotic arms work together to lift and place cloth on a hanger.
- Implemented image processing to verify placement using cloth color detection.
- Project aimed to improve object placement strategies through RL and sim-to-real transfer.

_Stack: Kinova Arms, Python, ROS, OpenCV_
